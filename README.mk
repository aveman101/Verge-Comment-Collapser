This little extension does one thing, and one thing only: it adds buttons to collapse comments on theverge.com!

It works in the comments section of articles, and also in the Verge forums.

The buttons themselves are designed entirely with CSS, which means that they'll look super crisp even on your Retina Display.

Install
=======

Chrome: from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mafmbkmnkdhabjjenmpjcbpdfagpkmfk?hl=en-US)

Safari: from the [downloads tab here on github](https://github.com/downloads/aveman101/Verge-Comment-Collapser/Verge%20Comment%20Collapser.safariextz)

Firefox, Opera, and other browses are not (yet) supported. If you are talented in creating extensions for these browsers, *please*, *please*, *please* look over this code (it's not a lot), build an extenion, and share (I would do it myself, but the Firefox extension API overwhlemed me, and it seems that so few people use Opera that I didn't bother). I will be **more than happy** to feature those extensions here.
